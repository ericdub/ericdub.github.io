          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>yhyhgfhgfhgfhfhfg</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
